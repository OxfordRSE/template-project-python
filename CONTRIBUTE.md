# Contributing to OxRSE

A `CONTRIBUTE.md` file can be used to show users how to contribute to your project (in this case our fictional project OxRSE).
This can include any community guidelines, but also style guides, or information about the development infrastructure.

## Development installation

To install as a developer, use

```
pip install -e .[dev,docs]
```

## Version control

We use [GIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) for version control, and [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) for project management.
